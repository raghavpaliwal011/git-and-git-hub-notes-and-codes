first question arises that what is git ?
answer --> it is a distributive version control system

define:
distributive version control system : it means that everyone in your app developement team has a copy of 
                                      the coding of app on which you are working

git hub : it is the website of git

IMPORTANT THING ABOUT GIT HUB : it saves our all the codes which we have pushed on it 
                                FOR EXAMPLE : you have done an important code and you have broken your laptop
                                              then you can get those codes from git hub 
                                
IMPORTANT --> you can get those codes only if you have pushed them on git hub

THINGS we need to do in git at first:

{1} we need to tell git our name and email
for that we need to enter the following command:

NAME :
        git comfig --global user.name raghav

EMAIL :
        git comfig --global user.email then your email id

to check your email and name enter the following programme:
    name:
            git comfig --global user.name

    email:
            git comfig --global user.email

{2} after that we need to initialize our folder for that enter :
                                                                git init
now to start coding through git enter:
                                        code .

{visual studio code will automatically open}
after opening all the required windows we need to set those in such a way that all are visible

=> now if you are done with the writing of all your codes and you have initialized your folder then save your
   codes and enter git status in git terminal 

   if it shows your files in red colour then it means your files are untracked
